This includes a thorough review of your medical history. You can		    down-load the Medical History Form (you may need the Adobe Acrobat Reader)		    and bring it with you, or you can fax it to us to save time at your initial		    appointment</p>		  <p>A treatment plan will then be developed and discussed with you. Sometimes,		    a second appointment is necessary to finalize our approach. Our goal is		    to comprehend and serve your needs, and this can only be accomplished through		    an open line of communication. Please feel free to participate in this		    process.</p>		  <p><strong>Bleaching</strong><br />		    Britesmile or Zoom? We now offer both! This is an in-office procedure		    that rapidly bleaches your teeth by 9-11 shades. We highly recommed		    a consultation first before you decide to bleach them, as it is not		    for everyone and there are some minor risks and consequences that		    we will detail for you upon your visit.</p>		  <p><strong>Cleanings<br />		  </strong>We believe a good foundation is the key to optimal oral health.		    We customize cleanings to properly care for your specific needs.		    This very simple element of dentistry can help prevent tooth loss,		    gum disease, and bad breath and in this way enhance your overall		    general health. Whether a six month checkup or full periodontal therapy,		    our hygienists will always strive to provide the very best treatment		    while maintaining your absolute comfort. You can even watch a movie		    while you visit!</p>		  <p><strong>Periodontal Disease Treatment</strong><br />		    Has it been years since you have visited		    the dentist? Do your gums ever bleed? Do you ever get bad breath? These		    symptoms are indications of a serious infectious, inflammatory and contagious		    disease that requires rigorous treatment. Periodontal disease results from		    bacteria collecting on the tooth surface above and below the gum line.		    This disease destroys gum tissues and bone and is the leading cause of		    tooth loss among adults. But the harm from periodontal disease expands		    beyond the mouth. Bacteria from periodontal diseases like to travel and		    it is a short trip from the mouth to the bloodstream. Once bacteria enter		    the bloodstream they can infect any major organ. But do not take our word		    for it, read the news on the latest research linking cardiovascular disease		    to periodontal disease.<br />		    <br />		    To combat this multifactor problem, we create an individualized treatment		    plan to eliminate infection of the gums and root surfaces. Depending on		    the severity of the disease, the following procedures may be part of this		    plan:</p>		  <p> 1. Eliminating tartar and plaque below the gum<br />		    2. Detoxifying the root surfaces where the disease occurs<br />		    3. Flushing out the pockets to allow for healthy reattachment of		    the gums to the root surfaces<br />		    4. Instruction on how to take care of your teeth at home</p>		  <p>We are committed to work with you to both restore your oral health, and		    lower your risk of occurrence of heart attack and stroke and severity of		    coronary artery disease.</p>		  <p><strong>Metal Free Dentistry</strong><br />		    Do you have metal fillings? It is a proven fact that		    mercury from amalgam fillings is devastating to your immune system, and		    can cause or increase the risk and severity of every known health condition.		    There is no safe level for mercury and even one atom of it will do some		    harm to the body. These fillings will continue to exert their toxic affects		    until they are removed from your teeth. We are dedicated to stop the problem		    at its root by discouraging the use of hazardous metals in our dental practices.		    However, if you already have metal fillings we will design a treatment		    plan to eliminate toxic dental materials and help you detoxify your body		    by neutralizing free radicals in cells that were infected with mercury.		    Once toxins are no longer added, the problems they cause should begin to		    reverse as healing begins.</p>		  <p><strong>Cosmetic Dentistry</strong><br />		    Veneers are the quickest and most popular way to create		    a beautiful smile as commonly seen on makeover TV programs. The process		    involves removing a minimal amount of tooth structure to make room for		    the veneer. The veneers are individually crafted at a state of the art		    dental lab, and after placement look like naturally beautiful teeth.<br />		    * Porcelain Crowns - Fully ceramic crowns are a more natural-looking		    alternative to traditional crowns that utilize a metal lining. This		    metal lining often prevents the crown from looking natural because light		    is not able to pass through porcelain-metal crown as it does with a natural		    tooth, and often the crowns leave a dark or gray line next to the gum-line.		    Crowns that are fully made of porcelain, on the other hand, mimic natural		    teeth and do not produce the black gum-line so common in porcelain-metal		    crowns.<br />		    * Teeth Whitening: Rather than give up your favorite coffee and tea		    beverages, even though they give a dull, yellowish shade to your		    smile, teeth whitening is a much easier solution. Teeth whitening is safe,		    effective, and efficient way to dramatically improve your overall appearance.		    We offer a wide range of whitening services and products and our team will		    help you choose the right one for you.</p>		  <p><strong>Dental Implants</strong><br />		    Are you missing teeth? Implants will significantly enhance		    your quality of life. They are the most advanced alternative to false teeth.		    They provide people with confidence to eat, speak, laugh and enjoy life		    to the fullest. Dental implants create a foundation for replacement teeth		    that look, feel and function like natural teeth. The implants consist of		    small titanium posts which are placed into the jawbone where teeth are		    missing. The bone bonds with titanium, creating a strong foundation for		    artificial teeth. Implants will allow you to regain the ability to eat		    virtually anything and smile with confidence. But more importantly, implants		    can help preserve your facial structure, preventing bone deterioration,		    a typical and serious side effect from living with missing teeth.</p>		  <p><strong>Night Guard</strong><br />		    Are you grinding your teeth or snoring? Both of these automatic		    behaviors may appear harmless on the surface, but they have deleterious		    effects on your health. Snoring can be a sign of a serious health condition		    called sleep apnea, which is a sleep related breathing disorder that causes		    your body to stop breathing during sleep. It typically occurs when the		    tissue in the back of the throat collapses and blocks the airway.<br />		    Teeth grinding and/or clenching causes extensive wear on your teeth,		    and can cause the facial muscles to overwork and becomes sore. Close to		    20% of the adult population engage in this behavior as it is a common response		    to a stressful life.<br />		    Night Guard often lessens both of these problems. It is an oral appliance		    that is worn in your mouth as you sleep. It is used to move the jaw forward		    and/or hold the mouth open. In this way, a Night Guard correctly fitted		    by our team will keep you from snoring and grinding your teeth.</p>		  <p><strong>Oral Cancer Screening</strong><br />		    The dental community is the first line of defense		    in early detection of oral cancer. However a recent study published by		    the ADA revealed that only 15% of dentists screen their patients as part		    of a regular exam. We are proud to be in this minority. Currently only		    half of all patients diagnosed with oral cancer survive more than five		    years, but this is because they are diagnosed in later stages. We have		    the skills and tools to ensure that early signs of cancer and pre-cancerous		    conditions are identified. Together with our patients, we can fight and		    win the battle against oral cancer through timely detection.</p>		  <p><strong>Teeth Whitening</strong><br />		    Teeth Whitening: Rather than give up your favorite coffee		    and tea beverages, even though they give a dull, yellowish shade to your		    smile, teeth whitening is a much easier solution. Teeth whitening is safe,		    effective, and efficient way to dramatically improve your overall appearance.		    We offer a wide range of whitening services and products and our team will		    help you choose the right one for you.</p>		  <p><strong>Root Canal Therapy</strong><br />		    Do you have a tooth ache? Are your teeth sensitive to		    hot or cold? Does the discomfort worsen at night? Any of these symptoms		    are a potential indications of nerve damage in your tooth. The nerve space		    inside a tooth can provide a nice cozy cave-like location for bacteria		    to persist because it's a place where your body's defense mechanisms can't		    get at them effectively. With this scenario, at best your body will only		    be able to ward off the infection caused by the bacteria living inside		    your tooth. At worst, this bacterial infection will overwhelm your body's		    defense mechanisms and pain and swelling will develop. If this condition		    is neglected it can cause a large abscess, which can in-turn lead to very		    severe consequences such as jaw bone destruction, airway construction,		    sinus infection, etc.</p>		  <p>In a nutshell, the process of root canal treatment first removes the bacteria,		    nerve tissue, and bacterial toxins from within the inner aspects of a tooth.		    Subsequently, once this space has been cleansed the second half of root		    canal treatment involves filling in and sealing up the interior of the		    tooth. This aspect of the treatment is an attempt to minimize the possibility		    that bacteria will be able to re-colonize the inner aspects of the tooth.</p>		  <p><strong>Orthodontic Treatment</strong><br />		    Our Orthodontic Team is Kid-friendly but can help		    mom and dad achieve their dream smiles as well. But proper tooth alignment		    does not only enhance aesthetics, it has been proven to help prevent gum		    disease, and increase better function, thus preventing early tooth loss.		    The orthodontic treatment period requires braces for 18-30 months for full,		    active treatment but sometimes as little as 6-12 months will do the job.		    Ideally your child should be examined by age 7 because some problems require		    early intervention and careful growth and eruption monitoring. Children		    seen earlier are often able to be treated without extraction of teeth since		    the orthodontist can start treatment at the perfect time. But missing that		    perfect time is not the end of the world. We are dedicated to help adults		    achieve the smile of their dreams while minimizing the embarrassing effects		    of wearing braces. Metal braces are not the only option now a day. We offer		    a number of nearly invisible solutions to serve your self presentation		    needs.</p>		  <p><strong>Sedation Dentistry</strong><br />		    Are you afraid of the dentist?

The source of this anxiety can be multifaceted but regardless		    of your personal history we are here to help.
